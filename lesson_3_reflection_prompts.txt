When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When you want to work collaboratively, or from different machines. 
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there might be changes on GitHub that you don't want to have on your local remote. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones of repositories on GitHub. 
Clones are copies of repositories, either on GitHub or between a remote (i.e. a machine) and GitHub. 
Branches are separate versions of code, with their own commit history.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can check the difference between your code and the remote code. And then you can do a merge between them, resolving any issues along the way.
