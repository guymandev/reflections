What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Several (hidden) metadata files are created. So that Git can track changes to the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like the sandbox. It reflects the current state of your files, whether they've been committed or not. Its value is as a sandbox.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area is what gets committed. So, by controlling what files/changes are in the staging area, you can control what goes into each commit. 
This makes it easier to ensure that there is one logical change per commit.
